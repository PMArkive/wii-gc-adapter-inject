801e6cd8
This is the address of the instruction that
writes player 1 GC input to 804de4b0 --
overwrite this with bl to custom input function
(find other controller port details later)
--Analog values are stored right next to buttons.

Should be able to put code in RAM with riivolution.

Possible code inject addresses: <--Nevermind
 80005bf4
 

Function that loads string "/dev/sdio/slot0": 803fa280


Other idea:
 Might be able to convert to gecko code by:
  find a way to use USB without libogc***
  gcc -S
  geckoDNET asm->C2


***HOLY DANG there's code for /dev/usb/* in ssbb boot.dol (Debug stuff???)
-- MABYE I CAN USE THAT! (File offset: 0x47a4dc) (8047E3E0 in RAM)
    Function 0x803fa558 uses said string
    Function 0x801d59ec (which calls 0x803fa558) is only called once
    -- its called by 801d5c98, likely init code
      ###803f8924 MIGHT be USB_Initialize();###No
      --Turns out the USB code is for initing bluetooth.
        Should'a seen it coming.
        
      BTW, USB_LOG will print if 0x805A0CD8 isn't 0



=== Symbol Checklist ===
Once these have all been located, USB_ReadIntrMsg and USB_WriteIntrMsg
can steal the functions from libogc and put it in a local header

[*] iosAlloc(s32 hid, s32 size)
[*] IOS_Ioctlv(s32 fd,s32 ioctl,s32 cnt_in,s32 cnt_io,ioctlv *argv)
[*] iosFree(s32 hid, void* ptr)


Looks like -Os needs symbols for __save_gpr_(r)_x
They're used in IUSB_OpenDeviceIds. Investigate.
 --Nevermind, this is inexplicably no longer a problem.


...It would seem, (with -O3,) the total code size is... 70704 bytes!

Note to self: nop = 0x60000000

Right, so the riivolution plan is BACK ON!
Still need to find code injection area, but things are ready
for when that happens.
--Going to branch to _start from function USB_LOG
  NTS: 0x2c000001 == cmpwi r0,1

REAL total code size: 6112 bytes
WOOOOAAAHAHH THIS FITS IN UNUSED VECTOR AREA 0x8001800
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDdd
 --Kind of a hollow victory 'cause GeckoOS uses this area for their
   codehandler, so I'll inevitably have to move at some point for
   Project M compatibility, but still...

Okay, note: code will be executed iff the make-the-game-think-
p1-has-a-gc-controller code works

TFW you have to make a custom build of dolphin just to test your hax.
Also, WHY DOLPHIN MMU NO ALLOW bl 0x80001800????
Oh, because CHEATS have to be ENABLED. RIGHT, SURE.

Okay, what the HECK. iosCreateHeap appearently takes TWO arguments,
and the first seems to be a STACK POINTER???? what on EARTH.
WHY is this NEVER referenced this way in libogc?????
  --Wait, error strings in the dol reference a "heap name"?!?!?!?
    --Nevermind this mess. I'm abandoning iosCreateHeap.
  
  
Alright, nevermind iosCreateHeap. I'm not using that after all.
But, iosAlloc is supposed to have THREE ARGUMENTS !?!?!?!?????? WHAT TO HECK
 --It gets weirder. Besides r5 having to not be NULL, it seems that
   EVERY call to iosAlloc within SSBB just sets r5 to 0x20, regardless of
   heapId or buffer size.
   --Come to think of it, it's fairly likely that this is the desired
     alignment of the returned buffer. Aligning it to 32 bytes DOES seem
     a little excessive, though... Idk.
     
So, SI_GetResponse is used for more than just the controller inputs,
so there's no immediate possibility of successfully branching to
adapter_thread from within there. However, I can't just REPLACE SI_GetResponse
within PAD_READ because I dunno exactly what SI_GetReponse returns.
(libogc is cryptic) But, if I can figure that out, this should be a
fairly elegant solution.

Seems 0x80212050 (__ipc_syncrequest), as called in
USB_WriteIntrMsg, is returning IPC_EINVAL
 --Probably a faulty IoCtlv
   --It seems it was just dolphin freaking
     needing root privliges to use USB (!?!?!)
     --Alright, now it seems to just be failing to transfer data
       to the adapter altogether (IOS_Ioctlv returning -1)
       --The problem was incorrect endpoints. Fixed.
       
IT WORKS!... Almost!
I've got it ACTUALLY writing data in memory of button inputs!!!
...Just in the wrong format. Here we go!
 --802161b4 is the call to SI_GetResponse
   8021658c is SPEC2_MakeStatus
   80029578 is PAD_ScanPads (probably)
   SI_GetStatus returns 0x20 with controller in
   
WOOT!!!!!!!
 --Button input is successfully being delivered to the game within dolphin.
   Analogue values aren't functional at all, and right now it requires
   a controller to be already plugged in for P1, but still.
   --Okay, HOLY. CRAP.
     It now works. Like, almost completely. Buttons, sticks.
     All controller ports, even. Time to do some testing and debugging!!!
     (Still not ready for console)
     
Note: <!-- nop Ioctlv NCD_GETCONFIG (This seems to cause problems???) -->
      <memory offset="0x8038eabc" value="0x60000000" />
      
Riivolution is dead.
  --That is, it's crashing on console, and I have no way of debugging it.
    So, as an alternative, I'm gonna try using a comPLETELY undocumented
    feature of Gecko OS, Gecko Patch Format. Fingers crossed this isn't
    just unimplemented TODO stuff in the source code. ;D
     Edit: I should mention that I happened upon the Gecko Patch File code
     while meandering through the gecko os source code. So, that was... lucky?
    --YESSSSSSSSS!!! It does in fact work!!!
      And I also have the single-word patches working in a GCT.
      So... It's all gecko now. :)
      All that's left... GOTTA FIND A HOME FOR MY CODE!!!
      
IT  W O R K S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (6/12/17)
  -- What were the chances of there being a big ol'
     COMPLETELY UNUSED buffer just after the hardware init code?
     :)))))))))))))))))
     There are a few bugs, and the latency isn't great, but IT WORKS!!!!
     First match ever played on a non-gc-compatible wii with an unmodified
     gamecube controller: Wario vs Wario, Final Destination. :)))))
